# weather station 
A simple weather station display that rotates through a current view, weekly forecast, and various webcams. I run this on an IBM 4707 9" monochrome CRT I found in a dumpster behind my college. Still worked even after being rained on!

The weather display is built using Angular 1.3 and the DarkSky.net service, as well as Wunderoground for their animated gif radar images. You can see a preview of the display at http://rosshettel.github.io/weatherstation
